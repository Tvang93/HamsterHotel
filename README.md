Review: The desktop version almost exacly the same as the figma. Everything is nicely done and orderly and the top navebar is nicely funtional. The only thing I would say is on mobile the image in the overview would take up a bit too much space, and the image in the reserve rooms seems out of place on the mobile.

Updated: reduced image size
